finally set up unit test infrastructure. needed files:


-----
my source files:
cppWriter/src/tests.cpp
cppWriter/src/cppWriter.cpp

binaries (in this case, archives) from when I built gtests manually from source
/home/samuel_sewall/cppWriter/gtestTry2/bin/libgtest.a 
/home/samuel_sewall/cppWriter/gtestTry2/bin/libgtest_main.a

header files for gtests (not sure why this wouldn't come along with the binaries):
googletest/googletest/include files
googletest/googlemock/include files

-----



goal with having gtests is 1) learn more about them, 2) eventually learn Cmake so that I can do this more normally, but most relevantly 3) know which of my functions I can depend upon
and probably 4) encourage me to write more organized code

works currently
case sensitive
punctuation sensitive

next up:
make it ignore punctuation
    7/20 - done
make it case insensitive
    7/20 - done
make it not write a final duplicate to current_true_word
    7/20 - done

next steps:
    maybe add a column to words_i_know for "guessed", and then add logic to the select so that guessed words aren't used
        this would eliminate the need for any kind of unique constraint on words_i_know
        but more importantly: it'd make it so that it's not just taking forever to run
        7/23/23 - done
    could also add logic to check: if all words have been guessed, and still no answer, then add the answer to words_i_know
        7/23/23 - done

other things I want to make:
    some way to import a list of words into words_i_know
    some way to show this on a browser
        ideally would have something to show that the last word is wrong/right
    some way to have browser give it new words?

    also, get it running on windows laptop
    get it to handle multiple lines from TrueFull
    figure out how to get git to have blank text files and ignore new stuff in them.
