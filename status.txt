finally set up unit test infrastructure. needed files:


-----
my source files:
cppWriter/src/tests.cpp
cppWriter/src/cppWriter.cpp

binaries (in this case, archives) from when I built gtests manually from source
/home/samuel_sewall/cppWriter/gtestTry2/bin/libgtest.a 
/home/samuel_sewall/cppWriter/gtestTry2/bin/libgtest_main.a

header files for gtests (not sure why this wouldn't come along with the binaries):
googletest/googletest/include files
googletest/googlemock/include files

-----



goal with having gtests is 1) learn more about them, 2) eventually learn Cmake so that I can do this more normally, but most relevantly 3) know which of my functions I can depend upon
and probably 4) encourage me to write more organized code
